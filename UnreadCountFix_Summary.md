# Unread Count Fix Summary

## Problem
The unread count badge in the MessagesView conversation list was not updating when messages were marked as read in the ConversationView.

## Solution
Added a notification-based mechanism to update the unread count in the message list when conversations are marked as read.

### Changes Made:

1. **MessagesViewModel.swift**:
   - Added a `Notification.Name` extension for `conversationMarkedAsRead`
   - Modified `setupRealtimeListeners()` to listen for this notification
   - When the notification is received, it updates the specific conversation's unread count to 0

2. **MessageService.swift**:
   - Modified `markConversationAsRead()` to post the `conversationMarkedAsRead` notification after successfully updating the database
   - The notification includes the conversation ID as its object

## How It Works:
1. When a user opens a conversation in `ConversationView`, it calls `markAsRead()`
2. The `MessageService` updates the database and posts a notification with the conversation ID
3. The `MessagesViewModel` receives this notification and updates the unread count for that specific conversation to 0
4. The UI automatically updates to hide the unread badge for that conversation

## Benefits:
- No UI flickering (avoids the previous issue with `objectWillChange`)
- Targeted updates (only the specific conversation is updated)
- Clean separation of concerns using notifications
- Real-time UI updates when messages are read
